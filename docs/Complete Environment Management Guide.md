## 2. Instance Provisioning and Management (AWS Managed by IBM)

### **What is an Instance?**
An instance is a specific deployment of watsonx Orchestrate service within AWS infrastructure, fully managed by IBM.

### **Instance Creation Process:**

#### **Step 1: Access Your Subscription**
```
AWS Marketplace Route:
1. Go to AWS Console → Marketplace → Manage subscriptions
2. Locate your watsonx Orchestrate subscription
3. Click "Set up your account" or "Configure"
4. You'll be redirected to IBM management console

Direct IBM Route:
1. Access IBM-provided management portal
2. Login with IBM ID credentials
3. Navigate to watsonx Orchestrate service
```

#### **Step 2: Configure Instance Settings**
```
Service name: [Your-Instance-Name]
AWS Region: [us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, etc.]
Environment Type: [Production, Development, Staging]
Plan: [essentials, standard]
Data Residency: [Specify if required]
```

#### **Step 3: Provision Instance**
```
1. Review configuration and AWS region selection
2. Accept IBM service terms
3. Click "Create" to provision on AWS
4. IBM manages all AWS infrastructure provisioning
5. Wait for instance to become active (typically 10-15 minutes)
```

#### **Step 4: Access Instance Details**
Once provisioned, you'll receive:
- **Instance GUID**: Unique global identifier
- **Instance ID**: Service-specific identifier
- **Dashboard URL**: Web interface access point (IBM-hosted)
- **API Endpoint**: AWS-hosted but IBM-managed endpoints
- **AWS Region Info**: Specific AWS region where your instance runs

### **Instance Management Best Practices (AWS Environment):**
- **Production Instance**: For live business operations in primary AWS region
- **Development Instance**: For building and testing in same or different AWS region
- **Staging Instance**: For pre-production validation
- **Multi-Region Strategy**: Consider AWS regions for disaster recovery
- **AWS Integration**: Leverage AWS monitoring and logging services
- **Cost Optimization**: Use AWS cost management tools alongside IBM pricing

## 3. User Management and Role Assignment (SaaS Model)

### **User Role Hierarchy in watsonx Orchestrate SaaS:**

#### **watsonx Orchestrate SaaS Roles (Simplified Model):**
| Role | Permissions | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Admin** | Full service control | Manage users, connect applications, configure instances |
| **Builder** | Create and edit resources | Build assistants, create agents, develop automations |
| **User** | End-user interaction | Run assistants, execute skills, perform daily tasks |

**Note**: In the SaaS model, you don't need to manage IBM Cloud platform roles or AWS IAM roles. The service handles all infrastructure permissions automatically.

## 4. Adding Users to Your Environment (AWS SaaS - IBM Managed)

### **Important Note for AWS SaaS Deployments:**
Since watsonx Orchestrate is delivered as a **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** solution on AWS:
- **No AWS IAM roles required** - Users don't need AWS accounts or permissions
- **No AWS console access needed** - All management through IBM interfaces
- **Pure SaaS model** - IBM handles all infrastructure and platform management
- **User management is entirely IBM-side** - Through IBM's identity management system

### **Method 1: IBM Identity Management (Only Method Needed)**

#### **Adding Individual Users (SaaS Model):**
```
1. Access IBM watsonx Orchestrate management portal
2. Navigate to User Management section
3. Click "Invite users" or "Add users"
4. Enter user email addresses
5. Assign watsonx Orchestrate roles:
   - Admin: Full administrative control
   - Builder: Create and manage assistants/agents
   - User: End-user access to assistants
6. Send invitations
```

**Key Points:**
- Users receive email invitations with direct SaaS access links

## 7. Environment Management Best Practices

### **Multi-Environment Strategy (AWS Deployment):**
```
Production Environment (AWS Region: us-east-1):
├── Admin: IT Operations team
├── Builders: Core development team
└── Users: All business users

Development Environment (AWS Region: us-west-2):
├── Admin: Development lead
├── Builders: All developers
└── Users: Test users

Staging Environment (AWS Region: us-east-1):
├── Admin: QA lead
├── Builders: Selected developers
└── Users: QA team + pilot users
```

### **SaaS-Specific Considerations:**
- **No AWS Console Access**: Users never interact with AWS directly
- **Simplified Management**: No complex IAM policies or AWS permissions
- **Direct SaaS Access**: Users access through IBM-provided URLs
- **Automatic Scaling**: AWS infrastructure scales automatically without user intervention
- **Billing Transparency**: AWS infrastructure costs handled by IBM, you pay for SaaS usage only

### **Access Control Strategy:**
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign minimum required permissions
2. **Role-Based Access**: Use consistent role assignments across environments
3. **Access Groups**: Leverage IBM Cloud access groups for scalability
4. **Regular Reviews**: Audit user access periodically

### **Instance Security Configuration:**
- Enable appropriate authentication methods
- Configure network access controls
- Implement audit logging
- Regular security assessments

### **Development Workflow:**
```
1. Developers build in Development instance
2. Promote tested solutions to Staging
3. Final validation in Staging environment
4. Deploy to Production with proper approvals
```
